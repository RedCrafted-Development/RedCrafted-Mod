# RedCraftedMod #
A modification for the RedCrafted minecraft server.
Read below for the UMCM readme.
Our mod is generally made the support the [RedCrafted MineCraft Server](http://redcrafted.com)
Since we are not allowed to release our mod due to the TFM & UMC Licenses you need to compile it yourself, soon we will make a guide to compiling it. You are fully allowed to fork our mod but PLEASE leave us the credits. For example, leave the readme and leave our ranks but change them to RC-Developer(redcrafteddeveloper) and change Owner to RC-Owner  and only do that to the important ranks. 
RedCraftedMod was a forked version of UnraveledMCMod (below) and that is a fork of TFM. We then modified UMCM to our own likings, by we we mean, Decy(decyj145) Ezelvar also known as SaltShaker & xXGlassShardsXx. TFM was coded by Steven Lawson (Madgeek1450)
and Jerom van der Sar (Prozza), but none of the RCM Developers actually develop TFM. Soon further information on our mod will be available.

# UnraveledMCMod #
UnraveledMCMod was a forked version of TotalFreedomMod. Ivan Morgan, otherwise known as AwesomePinch, then modified it, and OxLemonxO,
RobinGall2910, and CreeperSeth then started to contribute to it along with him. TotalFreedomMod, as stated above (no-longer stated above), was coded by Steven Lawson (Madgeek1450)
and Jerom van der Sar (Prozza), and was not officially started by Ivan Morgan, or any of the UMC developers. As for rules:

Due to the the TFM license, we are not allowed to release official release jars of the plugin. You will have to compile UMC with eclipse
for yourself!

You are ALSO NOT ALLOWED TO SEND THE COMPILED VERSIONS OF UMC NOR TFM TO ANYONE!!! It is against the rules!
